Flutter Application Name - Skylark

GitHub Repository - [https://github.com/Lionel-Lim/Skylark](https://github.com/Lionel-Lim/Skylark)

  

## Introduction to Application

Skylark is a mobile application designed to assist users in identifying and discovering unknown places within their vicinity using Google Maps. Developed with Flutter, the app offers cross-platform compatibility for both Android and iOS devices. Leveraging the device's camera, users can point their mobile phone towards a place of interest, and the app searches for all places within a configurable radius. To provide a personalised experience, Skylark allows users to sort the results by distance or popularity.

The primary goal of Skylark is to create a seamless and engaging user experience that fosters a deeper connection between users and their surroundings. By offering an easy-to-use interface and sorting capabilities, Skylark delivers a unique and tailored approach to urban exploration, empowering users to uncover the hidden in their city.
